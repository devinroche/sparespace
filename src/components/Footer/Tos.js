              <strong>Nondiscrimination Policy</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              sparespace is, at its core, an open community dedicated to
              connecting people to improve storage. sparespace welcomes and
              services an incredibly diverse community, drawing together
              individuals of different cultures, values, and norms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sparespace community is committed to building a world where
              people from every background feel welcome and respected. We are
              all committed to doing everything we can to help eliminate all
              forms of unlawful bias, discrimination, and intolerance from our
              platform. We want to promote a culture within the sparespace
              community—hosts, renters and people just considering whether to
              use our platform—that goes above and beyond mere compliance. To
              that end, all of us, sparespace employees, hosts and renters
              alike, agree to read and act in accordance with the following
              policy to strengthen our community and realize our mission of
              ensuring that everyone can belong, and feels welcome, anywhere.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Inclusion – We welcome renters of all backgrounds with authentic
                hospitality and open minds. Joining sparespace, as a host or
                renter, means becoming part of a community of inclusion. Bias,
                prejudice, racism, and hatred have no place on our platform or
                in our community. While hosts are required to follow all
                applicable laws that prohibit discrimination based on such
                factors as race, religion, national origin, and others listed
                below, we commit to do more than comply with the minimum
                requirements established by law.
              </li>
              <li>
                Respect - We are respectful of each other in our interactions
                and encounters. By connecting people from different backgrounds,
                sparespace fosters greater understanding and appreciation for
                the common characteristics shared by all human beings and
                undermines prejudice rooted in misconception, misinformation, or
                misunderstanding.

            <h3>
              <strong>WHEN RENTERS ARE TURNED DOWN</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Hosts should keep in mind that no one likes to be turned down.
              While a host may have, and articulate, lawful and legitimate
              reasons for turning down a potential renter, it may cause that
              member of our community to feel unwelcome or excluded. Hosts
              should make every effort to be welcoming to renters of all
              backgrounds. Hosts who demonstrate a pattern of rejecting renters
              from a protected class (even while articulating legitimate
              reasons), undermine the strength of our community by making
              potential renters feel unwelcome, and sparespace may suspend hosts
              who have demonstrated such a pattern from the sparespace platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the sparespace community grows, we will continue to ensure that
              sparespace’s policies and practices align with our most important
              goal: To ensure that renters and hosts feel welcome and respected
              in all of their interactions using the sparespace platform. The
              public, our community, and we ourselves, expect no less than this.

              As a Member, you may create Listings. To this end, you will be
              asked a variety of questions about the Space to be listed,

              features, availability of the Space and pricing and related rules
              and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the
              Site, App and Services, all Space must have valid physical
              addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site
              and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Space via
              the Site and Services based upon the information provided in your

              You understand and agree that sparespace does not act as an

              your space, any agreement you enter into with such Renter is
              between you and the Renter and sparespace is not a party thereto.
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, sparespace serves as the limited

              If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Space via
              the Site or Services, you will be required to either confirm or
              reject the booking within 48 hours of when the booking is
              requested (as determined by sparespace in its sole discretion) or
              the booking request will be automatically cancelled. When a
              booking is requested via the Site or Services, we will share with
              you (i) the first and last name of the Renter who has requested
              the booking, and (ii) a disclosure of the items that the renter
              wishes to store, and (iii) the start and end dates of the
              requested booking period (iiii) a link to the Renter's sparespace
              Account profile page. If you are unable to confirm or decide to

              amounts collected by sparespace for the requested booking will be
              refunded to the applicable Renter's credit card and any
              pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you

              an email or text message or other method of notification
              confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via
              the Site and Services. After confirming a booking, if a Renter
              wishes to store additional items or remove items, you will receive
              a notification via sparespace.com. Inaction on your (the

              The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Space Fees
              (defined below), the Service Fees (defined below), and the
              Processing Fees (defined below). Where applicable, Taxes may be
              charged in addition to the Space Fees, Service Fees, and
              Processing Fees. The Space Fees, the Service Fees, the Processing
              Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these
              Terms as the "Total Fees". The amounts due and payable by a Renter

              Please note that it is the Host and not sparespace, which
              determines the Space Fees. The Space Fee may include a
              non-refundable cleaning fee at the Host's discretion. Space Fees
              may also include applicable state or county parking and storage
              taxes. The Host will be responsible for paying the Processing Fees
              in full. You authorize sparespace to deduct a sum from the Space
              Fees to cover the Processing Fees. You also authorize sparespace

              Fees". The standard Service Fee charged by sparespace is fifteen
              (15) percent of the applicable Space Fee. The Service Fees are
              added to the Space Fees to calculate the Total Fees. Except as
              otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Processing Fees are to cover the merchant services and direct

              confirmation (i.e. when the Host confirms the booking within 48
              hours of the booking request) and will initiate payment of the
              Space Fees to the Host after the booking period is over.
              Additional fees may be charged for Renter&rsquo;s delayed removal
              of stored items. If the booking period exceeds one (1) month, or
              if the one-month rental period is extended (by agreement between
              Renter and Host, or by Renter&rsquo;s failure to remove stored

              basis each month of the booking period, referred to herein as
              Recurring Payments. sparespace will collect Total Fees and

              the end of the rental period- each month- when storage services
              have been rendered. If Recurring Payments apply to your payment

              Prohibited Items&rdquo; below, resulting in damage to the

              listing) without the Host&rsquo;s knowledge and the storage of
              those undisclosed or prohibited items resulted in damage to the

              If Renter is in "default," Host shall take reasonable steps to
              notify Renter of such default, and provide Renter a reasonable
              opportunity to cure such default. If Renter fails to cure such
              default, after receiving such notice and opportunity to cure, Host
              may exercise one or more of the following remedies:
            </p>

              (b) Terminate Renter's Booking by giving Renter three (3) days'
              notice to vacate; and if Renter fails to vacate and Host files an
              eviction lawsuit, Renter will pay Host's attorneys' fees and court
              costs plus a reasonable judicial eviction charge for Host's time,

            </p>
            <p>
              Seizure and sale will only be for default in paying sums due to

            <h3>Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
              You and sparespace mutually agree and acknowledge that all claims
              and disputes arising under or relating to these Terms and
              Conditions, or the breach, termination, enforcement, or
              interpretation or validity thereof are to be settled by binding
              arbitration in Salt Lake City, Utah or another location mutually
              agreeable to the parties, and not in a court of law. The
              arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration
              Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) and shall be conducted on a
              confidential basis pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
              the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and sparespace both acknowledge and agree that we are each
              waiving the right to trial by jury in all arbitrable disputes. You
              and sparespace also both acknowledge and agree that we are each
              waiving the right to participating as a plaintiff or class member
              in any purported class action or representative proceeding in all
              such disputes. Further, unless You and sparespace otherwise agree
              in writing, any arbitration will be conducted on an individual
              basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or
              representative proceeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any decision or award as a result of any such arbitration
              proceeding shall be in writing and shall provide an explanation
              for all conclusions of law and fact and shall include the
              assessment of costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees. Any
              such arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator experienced
              in the &ldquo;Sharing Economy,&rdquo; and shall include a written
              record of the arbitration hearing. The parties reserve the right
              to object to any individual who shall be employed by or affiliated
              with a competing organization or entity. An award of arbitration
              may be confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction. The parties
              shall endeavor to settle any such dispute via good faith
              negotiation prior to initiating any arbitration proceeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement include (i) any claim
              related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
              violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade
              secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights; or (ii)
              any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent
              circumstances. Any claim in exception to the above agreement to
              arbitration shall be brought into judicial proceeding in a court
              of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be
              unenforceable or unlawful, those unenforceable or unlawful
              portions shall be severed from these terms. The severance of
              unenforceable or unlawful portions of this Arbitration Agreement
              shall not have any impact on the remainder of the Arbitration
              Agreement, which shall be given full force and effect.
            </p>
